# Untangle
In the time of writing this is my proudes project, I hope it will get outshadowed by other one soon.

This is Untangled, it is a desktop app that takes in parameters of mouse positions and tasks you want it to do as well as other details such as number of repetitions of a certain task,
delay between each repetition, etc.

I had a need at my work where I had a sequence of 10ish mouse acitivities to do(mostly clicks) that took away half an hour of work every day.
Self-initiationally I decided to automate that job and as well as create a tool that will help me automate simillar future work. It helped my colleagues as well when I presented it in front of a company.

Multiple tasks are called a sequence, you can execute a sequence multiple times. Also, you can export/import it so you don't have to put parameters every time you turn the app on.

There is an Easter EGG sequence that you can import and start. It shows Untangled abilities.

it is called Untangled as it helps you untangle your boring redundant process loop you are in :)
